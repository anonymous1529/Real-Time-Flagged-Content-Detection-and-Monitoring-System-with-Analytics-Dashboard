**Real-Time Flagged Content Detection and Monitoring System with Analytics Dashboard**üßê
This project involves the monitoring of computer activity to detect and log flagged content based on predefined keywords. It includes both keyboard input monitoring and automated actions such as capturing screenshots, webcam images, and blocking activities when inappropriate content is detected. The flagged content is logged in a text file and an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. A web-based dashboard, built with Streamlit, allows for viewing, filtering, and visualizing the flagged content, providing insights into trends, flagged words, and the most frequent platforms involved. This system is designed for the purpose of ensuring safe and appropriate use of computer systems, particularly for children or restricted environments.
